            The main purpose of musicGuru is to re-design your music collection. This process has 3 main steps: <a href="build.htm">Build</a>, <a href="design.htm">Design</a>, <a href="materialize.htm">Materialize</a>. In this help file, there is a section dedicated to each of these steps. These sections are very verbose and explain everything you need to know about each step. Thus, you might want to have a more practical help, and this is where the <a href="howto/index.htm">How To</a> section comes handy. In this section, you have detailed steps for most tasks you might want to accomplish with musicGuru.
