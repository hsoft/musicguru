When you're finished with your design, it's time to materialize. There are 3 types of materialization.

Materialize design in-place
-----

This will simply perform the renaming operations required to create your design. All songs will be kept in their respective location. That is, if you have 2 locations in your design board, songs won't be mixed between them. Of course, you can't do this with locations from removable media. If you had such a location in your board, it will simply be ignored.

Move design to another location
-----

This will move all songs from the design board in the same location. If you included a location from a removable media, you will be prompted for it during the operation, and the songs will be **copied** from it instead of moved. This operation is usually used when you have songs in 2 or more locations that you want to merge together, so you can remove one of them.

Copy design to another location
-----

This is quite like *Move design to another location*, except that **everything** is copied instead of moved, including the removable medias.
