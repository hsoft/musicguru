### What is the first thing I should do when I first open musicGuru?

You should first [build](build.htm) your musicGuru collection, then [design](design.htm) it, and then [materialize](materialize.htm) your design.

### Some of the directories in my design board have a red exclamation point. What's up?

The red exclamation point means that the directory contains conflictual songs. There is a [How To page](howto/resolve_conflicts.htm) about resolving conflicts.
