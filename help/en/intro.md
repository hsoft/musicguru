The main purpose of musicGuru is to re-design your music collection. This process has 3 main steps: [Build](build.htm), [Design](design.htm), [Materialize](materialize.htm). In this help file, there is a section dedicated to each of these steps. These sections are very verbose and explain everything you need to know about each step. Thus, you might want to have a more practical help, and this is where the [How To](howto/index.htm) section comes handy. In this section, you have detailed steps for most tasks you might want to accomplish with musicGuru.

It is a good idea to keep musicGuru updated. You can download the latest version on the [musicGuru homepage](http://www.hardcoded.net/musicguru/).
